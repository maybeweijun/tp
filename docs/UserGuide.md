# FoodTrail User Guide

FoodTrail is a **desktop app for managing restaurants, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still 
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, FoodTrail can help you manage your favourite 
restaurants faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed on your computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T14-3/tp/releases/tag/v1.4).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your FoodTrail app.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar foodtrail.jar` 
   command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
    <img src="images/Ui.png" width=65% height=65% alt="Ui">

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list`: Lists all restaurants.

   * `add n/KFC a/701A Yishun Ave 5, #01-02, Singapore 761701 hp/62226111 t/fastfood t/chicken`: Adds a restaurant 
     named `KFC` to the restaurant directory.

   * `delete 3`: Deletes the 3rd restaurant shown in the current list.

   * `clear`: Deletes all restaurants.

   * `exit`: Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/KFC`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/KFC t/fastfood` or as `n/KFC`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/fastfood`, `t/fastfood t/halal` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME hp/PHONE_NUMBER`, `hp/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

  keywords will be listed.

Examples:
* `find koi` returns `KOI Thé` and `KOI Thé Specialty`.
* `find subway, kfc` returns `Subway` and `KFC`.

users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, FoodTrail will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the FoodTrail app to behave in unexpected ways (e.g. if a value entered is 
outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: Where is my restaurant data stored?<br>
**A**: FoodTrail stores your data locally on your computer. The exact location is usually within the application's data directory, ensuring your information is private and accessible offline. <br>
**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous FoodTrail home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
